# Image-Classification-in-Traffic-Signals
1. Dataset Selection and Preprocessing
High-quality datasets like the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) are commonly used. These datasets contain thousands of labeled images representing various traffic signs. Preprocessing steps include:

Resizing images to a uniform dimension (e.g., 32Ã—32 pixels)

Converting images to grayscale to reduce computational complexity

Normalizing pixel values to a standard range

Applying data augmentation techniques such as rotation, flipping, and noise addition to enhance model robustness .

2. Model Architectures
Several deep learning architectures have been employed for traffic signal classification:

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): CNNs are widely used due to their effectiveness in feature extraction from images. For instance, a lightweight CNN achieved 99.20% accuracy on the GTSRB dataset with only 0.8 million parameters .

Inception Networks: These networks utilize inception modules to capture multi-scale features, enhancing classification performance .

AlexNet: A deep CNN architecture that has been adapted for traffic light recognition by resizing input images and applying data augmentation techniques .

YOLOv4: A real-time object detection model that has been used for traffic sign detection, achieving a mean average precision (mAP) of 59.88% at 35 frames per second .

3. Training and Optimization
Models are trained using labeled datasets, employing optimization algorithms like Adam to minimize loss functions such as categorical cross-entropy. Regularization techniques like dropout are applied to prevent overfitting, and batch normalization is used to stabilize training .
